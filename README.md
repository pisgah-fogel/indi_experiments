Indi experiments, home made telescope driver

# Setup
I use kstars / Ekos to control my Canon EOS 1100D camera. My plan is to control my home made mount with it

## List of Astronomy oriented projets I have
- 3D print a focuser (Crayford) - models available online

- Make a motorized AZ mount

- Test a new drive system for telescope: use a laser measuring technique to measure the motor (+gearbox) rotation. Coupled with an elastic connection with the telescope and thus filter small variations, resulting in a smother movement
